# Merge Sort Visualization
This is a final project for CPSC 335 - Algorithm Engineering.  I originally was going to make a React JS project for Red-Black Binary Search Trees, but decided that a merge sort would be more doable with the time alloted to this project, so please ignore the file structure, as it was not corrected.


## Project Description
The project currently only sorts randomly generated arrays.  I'm thinking of adding functionality for the user to create a new array (inserting and deleting different array elements), so they can see how it would be sorted.

### Installing Project
You will need to make sure that npm is up to date, and install react. This project didn't require any additional dependencies, so a basic installation of React should work.  If not, please let me know.

## ~Bugs~  Features
The project currently only generates arrays from the number 25 to 500, this is so that it retains styling and the numbers are visible with the blue background.
The numbers currently do not update properly on the visual aspect of the project, but the sorting is working - I have commented out the code so that there are no numbers present.
