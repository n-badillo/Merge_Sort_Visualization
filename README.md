# Merge Sort Visualization
This is a final project for CPSC 335 - Algorithm Engineering.  I originally was going to make a React JS project for Red-Black Binary Search Trees, but decided that a merge sort would be more doable with the time alloted to this project, so please ignore the file structure, as it was not corrected.


## Project Description
The project currently only sorts randomly generated arrays.  I'm thinking of adding functionality for the user to create a new array (inserting and deleting different array elements), so they can see how it would be sorted.

## ~Bugs~  Features
The project currently only generates arrays from the number 25 to 500, this is so that it retains styling and the numbers are visible with the blue background.
